# Capstone1

Here you will find exploratory graphs and charts for my Capstone 1 project. The topics I am exploring are as follows:
  - YouTube engagement by country - which countries seem to have more engagement on the platform
  - YouTube video categories and what types of videos are most popular
  - Looking for relationships between number of views and likes
  - Looking at activity in different countries - likes, content creation (videos posted), etc. - and looking at whether there are significant differences between countries
